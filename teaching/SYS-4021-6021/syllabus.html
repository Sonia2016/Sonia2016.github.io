        <strong>Course Description: </strong>
          What are the contributing factors to the severity of train accidents?  How do you predict if an e-mail is spam?  How can you translate goal-directed problems such as these into actionable decisions and meaningful recommendations that can have vast societal implications?  How can you harness multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data to analyze the problem?  In this course, we will explore Evidence Informed Systems Engineering (EISE) practices and how they can be applied to difficult, open-ended problems. 
          The primary tools for EISE come from linear statistical models and this course demonstrates the use of these models for problem understanding, prediction, and control. Specific topics include multiple regression, principal components, analysis of covariance, logistic regression, time series analysis, simulation and bootstrapping. In class, we will concentrate on the theory and practice of model construction, while the projects and assignments provide open-ended problem solving situations that illustrate the broad applicability of the methods.

        <strong>Learning Objectives: </strong> 
        (a) Apply evidence-informed systems engineering approaches to solve real-world problems. , 
        (b) Assess the limitations of the information available to solve a problem, 
        (c) Identify the appropriate statistical modeling technique(s) appropriate for a specified problem,
        (d) Derive an actionable recommendation with statistical confidence using the evidential reasoning process,
        (e) Formulate meaningful, testable hypotheses from a real-world problem and associated data,
        (f) Uncover bias, error, outliers, and influential observations in data using multi-dimensional visualization techniques, and
        (g) Communicate the application of the evidence-informed systems engineering process to a problem through a technical summaries/reports directed to a client and / or practicing engineer.

        <strong>Submission and Late Submission Policy: </strong> 
        On the day a project is due you must submit an electronic copy <strong>in pdf (NOT doc or docx, etc.)</strong> along with source code on the Collab site and pledge your submission.
        No late assignments will be accepted in this class. Unless the student has procured special accommodations for warranted circumstances. 
        We acknowledge the ongoing pandemic and want to be mindful of any special circumstances associated with it. 
        We will be accommodating also due to exceptional circumstances but this is a large class so please make sure this is truly warranted and contact us as soon as possible.
        In many cases you will do better to submit an incomplete assignment rather than a late one.
        Please take into account that due to the ongoing pandemic the grading policies of this class have already been relaxed to drop the lowest scored assignment from the final
        grade computations, this includes an assignment with a grade of zero that was not submitted for whatever reason. 
      </p>
      <p id="recording" style="padding-top: 1em;">
        <strong>Recording of Lectures: </strong>
        We will be recording every lecture in order to accommodate students who will be learning remotely -- 
        however there might be small discussions pre and post-lecture which might not be recorded -- if these take place they are not considered essential and they will
        be communicated through other means (e.g. email or UVA Collab). Because lectures include fellow students, you and they may be personally identifiable on the recordings. 
        We might set aside some time at the end for questions that will not be recorded -- this will be announced when it takes place.
        These recordings may only be used for the purpose of individual or group study with other students enrolled in this class during this semester. 
        You may not distribute them in whole or in part through any other platform or to any persons outside of this class, nor may you make your own recordings 
        of this class unless written permission has been obtained from the Instructor and all participants in the class have been informed that recording will occur. 
        If you want additional details on this, please see Provost Policy 008 and follow-up guidelines. 
        <strong>If you notice that we have failed to activate the recording feature, please remind us!</strong>

      <p id="integrity" style="padding-top: 1em;">
        <strong>Academic Integrity Statement: </strong> 
        "The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. 
        We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, 
        cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can 
        destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles 
        of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 
        Students are expected to be familiar with the <a href="http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud">university honor code</a>, 
        including the section on academic fraud." 
        In summary, if assignments are individual then no two students should submit the same source code -- any overlap in source code of 
        sufficient similarity will be potentially flagged as failure to abide to the Honor Code. You can discuss, you can share resources, you can talk
        about the assignment but not share code as this would potentially incur on an honor code violation.
        Regardless of circumstances I will assume that any source code, text, or images submitted alongside reports or projects are of the authorship
        of the individual students unless otherwise explicitly stated through appropriate means. Any missing information regarding sources will be regarded potentially
        as a failure to abide by the academic integrity statement even if that was not the intent. Please be careful clearly stating
        what is your original work and what is not in all assignments.

      <p id="discrimination" style="padding-top: 1em;">
        <strong>Discrimination and power-based violence:</strong>
        The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:(1)Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated. (2)Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds. If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - <a href="www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence">www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence</a>.As your professors and as persons, know that we care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as we can. As a faculty member, we are a responsible employee, which means that we are required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you wish to report something that you have seen, you can do so at the <a href="http://justreportit.virginia.edu/">Just Report It</a> portal. The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.

      <p id="religious" style="padding-top: 1em;">
        <strong>Religious Accommodations: </strong> 
        It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by Piazza private message as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at 
        <a href="UVAEOCR@virginia.edu">UVAEOCR@virginia.edu</a> or 434-924-3200.
